# AI Location Detection in GlobeTrotter

GlobeTrotter uses advanced AI technology to automatically detect locations in your travel photos. This guide explains how the feature works and how to get the best results.

## How It Works

1. **Image Analysis**: When you upload a photo, our AI system analyzes it for recognizable landmarks, architectural features, and natural landscapes.
2. **Location Matching**: The system compares these features against a vast database of known locations worldwide.
3. **Coordinate Generation**: When a match is found, the system provides precise GPS coordinates.

## Best Practices

For optimal results:

- Use clear, well-lit photos
- Include distinctive landmarks when possible
- Avoid heavily filtered or edited images
- Ensure the photo is in JPEG format
- Keep file sizes under 10MB for fastest processing

## Supported Features

The AI can recognize:
- Famous landmarks
- Architectural styles
- Natural landscapes
- Urban environments
- Cultural monuments

## Limitations

The system may have reduced accuracy with:
- Indoor photos
- Night-time shots
- Heavily cropped images
- Generic landscapes without distinctive features

## Manual Override

If the AI detection isn't accurate, you can always:
1. Click on the map to set the location manually
2. Drag the pin to adjust the position
3. Use the search bar to find specific locations

## Privacy Considerations

- No personal data is stored during analysis
- Images are processed securely
- Location data is only saved with your explicit consent

## Troubleshooting

If location detection fails:
1. Try uploading a different photo of the same location
2. Ensure the image meets the format requirements
3. Check if the location has distinctive features
4. Consider using manual location selection

## Future Improvements

We're continuously working to enhance the AI detection:
- Improved night photo analysis
- Better handling of indoor locations
- Faster processing times
- Support for more file formats
